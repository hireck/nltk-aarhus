#15. â—‘ Write programs to process the Brown Corpus and find answers to the following questions:
#a. Which nouns are more common in their plural form, rather than their singular form? (Only consider regular plurals, formed with the -s suffix.)
#b. Which word has the greatest number of distinct tags? What are they, and what do they represent?
#c. List tags in order of decreasing frequency. What do the 20 most frequent tags represent?
#d. Which tags are nouns most commonly found after? What do these tags represent?
