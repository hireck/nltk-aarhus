#18. â—‘ Generate some statistics for tagged data to answer the following questions:
#a. What proportion of word types are always assigned the same part-of-speech
#tag?
#b. How many words are ambiguous, in the sense that they appear with at least
#two tags?
#c. What percentage of word tokens in the Brown Corpus involve these ambiguous
#words?
